LLVM IR Trace Profiler (LLVM-Tracer) 1.2
========================================
LLVM-Tracer is an LLVM instrumentation pass to print out a dynamic LLVM IR
trace, including dynamic register values and memory addresses.

Requirements:
-------------------
  1. LLVM 3.4 and Clang 3.4 64-bit or LLVM 3.5 and Clang 3.5 64-bit
  2. GCC 4.7 or newer for C++11 features.
  3. CMake 2.8.12 or newer.

Build:
-----------------
**Breaking changes from v1.1 to v1.2:**

  * CMake is no longer optional. LLVM-Tracer only supports CMake for building.
    This is because of a new Clangtool component (under `ast-pass/`) which
    requires CMake.
  *  LLVM-Tracer will install all built files to the subdirectories `bin/` and
    `lib/` instead of `full-trace/` and `profile-func/`. The `BUILD_ON_SOURCE`
    option has been removed.

  CMake is a configure tool which allows you to do out-of-source build.
  LLVM-Tracer requires CMake newer than 2.8.12. By default, CMake
  searches for LLVM 3.4.

  1. Set `LLVM_HOME` to where you installed LLVM
     ```
     export LLVM_HOME=/path/to/your/llvm/installation
     ```

  2. Clone LLVM-Tracer.

     ```
     git clone https://github.com/ysshao/LLVM-Tracer
     cd LLVM-Tracer/
     ```
  3. Configure with CMake and build LLVM-Tracer source code.

     If you have LLVM installed:
     ```
     mkdir build/
     cd build
     cmake ..
     make
     make install
     ```

     If you want CMake to install LLVM for you (CAUTION: takes an hour!):
     ```
     mkdir build/
     cd build
     cmake .. -DLLVM_ROOT=/where/to/install/LLVM -DAUTOINSTALL=TRUE
     make
     make install
     ```

  3. (Optional) Try running triad example, which is built by CMake.
     ```
     cd /path/to/build/LLVM-Tracer/
     ctest -V
     ```

  4. Available CMake settings
     ```
     -DLLVM_ROOT=/where/your/llvm/install   (default : $LLVM_HOME)
       You may denote the path of LLVM to find/install by this option. if
       this option is not defined, environment variable LLVM_HOME will be
       used.

     -DLLVM_RECOMMEND_VERSION="3.4", "3.5"    (default : 3.4)
       LLVM-Tracer supports both LLVM 3.4 and 3.5. It uses LLVM 3.4 by
       default, but you can manually specify the LLVM version to use.

     -DAUTOINSTALL=TRUE,FALSE    (default : FALSE)
       By this option, CMake scripts will automatically download, build and
       install LLVM for you if finds no LLVM installation. Using this
       function requires tar-1.22 or newer to extract xz format.

       The default installation path is under /your/build_dir/lib/llvm-3.x.
       You can manually define the installation path by
       -DLLVM_ROOT=/where/to/install.

       The default installation version will be 3.4. You can define
       the installation version by -DLLVM_RECOMMEND_VERSION="3.5" or "3.4".
       This auto install script will try to use the latest patch version
       according to cmake-scripts/AutoInstall/LLVMPatchVersion.cmake

     -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=None,Debug,Release    (default : None)
       You can choose one from three of bulid types.
     ```


Run:
------
After you build LLVM-Tracer, you can use example triad programs in the example
directory to test LLVM-Tracer.

Example program: triad
----------------------
  1. Go to /your/path/to/LLVM-Tracer/example/triad
  2. Run LLVM-Tracer to generate a dynamic LLVM IR trace
     a. LLVM-Tracer tracks regions of interest inside a program.
        In the triad example, we want to analyze the triad kernel instead of the setup
        and initialization work done in main. To tell LLVM-Tracer the functions we are
        interested in, set the enviroment variable WORKLOAD to be the top-level function name:

        ```
        export WORKLOAD=triad
        ```

        If you have multiple functions, separate them with commas.

        ```
        export WORKLOAD=md,md_kernel
        ```

        LLVM-Tracer will trace them differently based on the `-trace-all-callees` flag, which can be specified
        to the `opt` command (see step d).

        * If this flag is specified, then any function called by any function in the WORKLOAD variable will be traced.
          This is a simple way to trace multiple "top-level" functions at once.
        * If this flag is not specified, then only functions in the WORKLOAD variable will be traced.

     b. Generate the source code labelmap.

        ```
        export TRACER_HOME=/your/path/to/LLVM-Tracer
        ${TRACER_HOME}/bin/get-labeled-stmts triad.c -- -I${LLVM_HOME}/lib/clang/3.4/include
        ```

     c. Generate LLVM IR:

        ```
        clang -g -O1 -S -fno-slp-vectorize -fno-vectorize -fno-unroll-loops -fno-inline -emit-llvm -o triad.llvm triad.c
        ```

     d. Run LLVM-Tracer pass.
        Before you run, make sure you already built LLVM-Tracer and have set
        the environment variable `TRACER_HOME` to where you put LLVM-Tracer
        code.

        ```
        opt -S -load=${TRACER_HOME}/full-trace/full_trace.so -fulltrace -labelmapwriter [-trace-all-callees] triad.llvm -o triad-opt.llvm
        llvm-link -o full.llvm triad-opt.llvm ${TRACER_HOME}/profile-func/trace_logger.llvm
        ```

        The `-trace-all-callees` flag is optional and defaults to false.

     e. Generate machine code:

        ```
        llc -filetype=asm -o full.s full.llvm
        gcc -fno-inline -o triad-instrumented full.s
        ```

     f. Run binary. It will generate a file called `dynamic_trace` under current directory.

       ```
       ./triad-instrumented
       ```

     g. There is a script provided which performs all of these operations.

       ```
       python llvm_compile.py $TRACER_HOME/example/triad triad
       ```

`triad` is part of the SHOC benchmark suite. We provide a version of SHOC that
is ready to be used with LLVM-Tracer. Please go to
[Aladdin](https://github.com/ysshao/aladdin) and look under the `SHOC`
directory.

Logan's Notes:
I've begun making a few edits to the program in an attempt to make it functional with newer versions of LLVM. At the moment, this still returns errors, so it isn't finished.
The changes that I've made have been to:
cmake-scripts/TracerConfig
ast-pass/CMakeLists
ast-pass/GetLabeledStmts
full-trace/SlotTracker
full-trace/full_trace.h

All of my changes have comments, so you can see my thought process and why I had to change something. I can not guarantee that they all
actually work at the time, as I'm still working on everything.
